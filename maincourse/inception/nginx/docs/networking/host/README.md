Host Networks:

How it works: A container using the host network shares the host's network stack. It gets the same IP address as the host and can access all network interfaces directly.
No isolation: There's no network isolation between the container and the host.
No port mapping: Port mapping is not necessary as the container's ports are directly accessible on the host.
When to use:
For high-performance applications where low latency is critical (e.g., monitoring agents).
When a container needs direct access to network devices on the host.
