A list of ideas to help you deepen knowledge of Docker and Nginx:
1. Experiment with different Nginx configurations:
   - Set up multiple virtual hosts
   - Configure SSL/TLS for HTTPS
   - Implement load balancing
   - Set up reverse proxy for other services

2. Explore Docker networking:
   - Create custom networks
   - Connect multiple containers
   - Understand bridge, host, and overlay networks

3. Optimize your Docker image:
   - Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Explore alpine-based images for smaller footprints

4. Implement Docker health checks:
   - Add a health check to your Nginx container
   - Configure Docker Compose to use health checks

5. Practice Docker volume management:
   - Use named volumes for persistent data
   - Explore bind mounts for development

6. Implement logging and monitoring:
   - Configure Nginx logging
   - Use Docker logging drivers
   - Integrate with monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana

7. Explore Docker Compose features:
   - Use environment variables and .env files
   - Implement depends_on and healthcheck options
   - Create multiple Compose files for different environments

8. Security practices:
   - Run Nginx as a non-root user
   - Implement content security policies
   - Use Docker secrets for sensitive information

9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for your Docker project
   - Implement automated testing and deployment

10. Explore container orchestration:
    - Learn Kubernetes basics
    - Deploy your Nginx container to a Kubernetes cluster

11. Performance tuning:
    - Optimize Nginx configuration for performance
    - Implement caching strategies

12. Explore other web servers:
    - Compare Nginx with Apache or Caddy
    - Set up multiple web servers in separate containers
