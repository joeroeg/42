/**
 * @brief The serialize function takes a pointer to a Data structure and converts it into a uintptr_t.
 * This conversion is done using reinterpret_cast, which is appropriate for conversions between pointer types and integral types.
 * @note Purpose:
 * Converts a pointer to an unsigned integer type (uintptr_t) without changing the bits of the pointer.
 * This allows the pointer's memory address to be stored or transmitted as a numeric value.

/**
 * @brief The deserialize function performs the inverse operation.
 * It takes a uintptr_t and converts it back to a Data* pointer.
 * @note Purpose: Converts the numeric representation back into a pointer, effectively "recreating" the original pointer from its numeric form.
 * This is crucial for scenarios where pointers are transmitted or stored in forms that require serialization.

/**
 * @brief To ensure that the serialize and deserialize functions work correctly,
 * you should test that a Data pointer, after being serialized and then deserialized, points back to the original Data object.
 * This verifies that the integrity of the pointer is maintained throughout the process.
 *
 * @details
 * Where and why it's used:
 * 1. Useful in systems programming for direct hardware access and operating systems development, where precise control over memory and resources is necessary.
 * 2. Performance Optimization: Important for implementing custom memory management and efficient data structures that require manipulation of memory addresses.
 * 3. Serialization and Communication: Essential for network communication and file systems where data structures need to be serialized for transmission or storage, making pointers transferable and interpretable across different systems.
 * 4. Security Implications: Used in security-sensitive applications to obfuscate addresses to prevent exploitation.
 * 5. Compatibility Across Architectures: Helps manage differences in pointer size and alignment across various computer architectures, enhancing software portability.
 * 6. Embedded Systems: Critical in embedded programming for setting up Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers, requiring precise address management.
