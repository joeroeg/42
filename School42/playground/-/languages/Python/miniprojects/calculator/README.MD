1. Addition and Subtraction:
To add or subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. Here's the general process:

a) If the denominators are already the same:
You can add or subtract the numerators directly and keep the denominator unchanged.

Example 1: 1/4 + 3/4 = (1 + 3)/4 = 4/4 = 1

b) If the denominators are different:
You need to find a common denominator, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. Then, adjust the numerators accordingly.

Example 2: 1/3 + 1/5 = (5/5) * (1/3) + (3/3) * (1/5) = 5/15 + 3/15 = 8/15

2. Multiplication:
To multiply fractions, simply multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.

Example 3: (2/3) * (4/5) = (2 * 4) / (3 * 5) = 8/15

3. Division:
To divide fractions, you multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal (flipped version) of the second fraction.

Example 4: (2/3) รท (4/5) = (2/3) * (5/4) = (2 * 5) / (3 * 4) = 10/12 = 5/6

Remember to simplify fractions by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor if necessary.

Here are a few additional tips:

Simplifying Fractions: Reduce fractions to their simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Mixed Numbers: A mixed number is a whole number combined with a fraction. To add, subtract, multiply, or divide mixed numbers, you'll usually need to convert them to improper fractions first.

Common Denominator: When adding or subtracting fractions, you'll often need to find a common denominator. The common denominator is the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators.

Reciprocal: The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and the denominator. It's used in division to turn the second fraction into its reciprocal and then perform multiplication.
